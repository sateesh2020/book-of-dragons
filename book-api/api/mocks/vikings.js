        "descriptionOne": "Not much is known about Gothi… mostly because she’s never actually been able to tell anyone about her past. All the people of Berk know is that Gothi’s been on the island since before they were born, and she’ll probably still be there long after they’ve left.",
        "descriptionTwo": "Recently, Hiccup and the other Dragon Riders learned that Gothi was part of a doomed Arctic expedition that ended prematurely due to a Snow Wraith attack. Gothi hadn’t left Berk since that fateful experience, even staying behind when the rest of the Vikings faced off against the Red Death on Dragon Island"

His rugged good looks and brawny physique appeals to the Ruffnut's inner-most desires, which turn out to be quite shallow. But despite his boastful, brash charisma, Eret lives in endless dread of Drago's merciless wrath, and will do anything to save his own skin."
